                <p> This was a project that I completed in CS 162, Berkeley's course on operating systems. I helped implement core OS functionalities, including process control, file operations, and multithreading within the PintOS kernel. Here is a link to the project spec: </p>

                <p> This was my final project for EECS 106A, Berkeley's introductory robotics course. In our lab section, we frequently worked with a <a className="underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur7e/">UR7E Robot</a>, a state of the art robot with six degrees of freedom (six revolute joints). My partners and I wanted to see how well this robot could emulate scrolling social media, giving rise to this ScrollBot project. Check out this <a className="underline" target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/eecs106afinalproject/home">website</a> we made, it goes into more detail about the project. </p>

                <p> There isn't a single standardized and validated scoring system specifically for Social Media content, but several established frameworks are commonly adapted to assess the quality and transparency of social media health content. The goal of this project was to develop an online scoring tool to assess the quality and accuracy of public health related content on Instagram Reels utilizing a newly devised scoring system tailored towards evaluating modern social media content. This gave rise to the Content Health Accuracy Index (CHAI), and the repository below contains code for a CHAI score calculator.</p>
