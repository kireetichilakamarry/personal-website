                <p> This was my final project for EECS 106A, Berkeley's introductory robotics course. In our lab section, we frequently worked with a <a className="underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur7e/">UR7E Robot</a>, a state of the art robot with six degrees of freedom (six revolute joints). My partners and I wanted to see how well this robot could emulate scrolling social media, giving rise to this ScrollBot project. Check out this <a className="underline" target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/eecs106afinalproject/home">website</a> we made, it goes into more detail about the project. </p>

                <p> This was a project for CS 61C, Berkeley's computer architecture course. I coded a neural network in RISC-V with a single-activation layer that could classify handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. Check out the spec for more details. </p>

                <p> This was a project for CS 61B, Berkeley's data structures and algorithms course. I created an engine in Java to randomly generate interactive Pac-Man-esque worlds. I also included save, load, and quit features alongside dynamically adjustable peripheral vision and collectible items. See the spec for more details. </p>

                <p> There isn't a single standardized and validated scoring system specifically for Social Media content, but several established frameworks are commonly adapted to assess the quality and transparency of social media health content. The goal of this project was to develop an online scoring tool to assess the quality and accuracy of public health related content on Instagram Reels utilizing a newly devised scoring system tailored towards evaluating modern social media content. This gave rise to the Content Health Accuracy Index (CHAI), and the repository below contains code for a CHAI score calculator.</p>
